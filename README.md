# File Random Numberer

## Description
The app takes a list of files and assigns numbers to them in a random order. A folder called "Files" is to be filled with all the files you wish to have renamed.

## Known Fault
Once the application has renamed all the files to be numbers, it cannot be immediately run again as it may attempt to rename files to the same name/extension, which causes the app to crash.
eg. application tries to name a file 1.png, a file is already named that (due to being previously ran), the program crashes.

## Design intent
My partner wanted to watch the simpsons but did not want to know episode they were going to watch. 
Included in the codebase are a QRCode, Link, and video with a QRCode to ensure the user can visit the pickerwheel I set up.
